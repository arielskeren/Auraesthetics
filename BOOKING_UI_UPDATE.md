# Booking UI Update - Complete

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **In-Site Booking Flow**
- Replaced redirects to Cal.com with embedded iframe modals
- Users stay on your site during booking
- Booking modal opens when clicking "Book Now"
- Shows service details before redirecting to Cal.com

### 2. **Consistent Card Layout**
- **All cards now have fixed heights**
- Buttons align at the bottom across all cards
- Content properly structured with flexbox:
  - Title (fixed position, not shrinking)
  - Description (flexible, grows to fill space)
  - Duration/Price bar (fixed at bottom)
  - Book Now button (fixed at very bottom)
- No more "floating" buttons or text

### 3. **New Components Created**
- `app/_components/BookingModal.tsx` - Modal for booking with service details
- Updated `app/book/BookClient.tsx` to use modal system
- Updated `app/_components/ServiceModal.tsx` to embed Cal.com iframe

### 4. **Technical Details**
- Modal uses framer-motion for smooth animations
- Cal.com booking opens in iframe overlay
- All cards use `flex flex-col` with proper flex utilities
- Consistent spacing: `min-h-[3rem]` for descriptions
- All interactive elements have consistent hover states

## Testing

6. Modal closes automatically after booking

## Visual Improvements
