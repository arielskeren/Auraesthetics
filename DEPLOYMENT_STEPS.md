## Part 2: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

### Step 4: Get DNS Information from Vercel

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `auraesthetics.com`)
5. Vercel will show you DNS records to add:
   - **A Record:** IP address for `@` (root domain)
   - **CNAME Record:** For `www` subdomain (usually points to cname.vercel-dns.com)

**Example of what Vercel will show:**
```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       76.76.21.21
CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com
```

## Part 5: Configure DNS in GoDaddy

### Step 5: Log into GoDaddy

1. Go to: https://www.godaddy.com
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. Go to **My Products** â†’ **Domains**

### Step 6: Access DNS Settings

1. Find your domain (e.g., `auraesthetics.com`)
2. Click **DNS** (or three dots â†’ DNS)
3. You'll see your current DNS records

### Step 7: Update DNS Records

**Important:** Don't delete all records at once. Add the new ones first!

1. **Add A Record for Root Domain (@):**
   - **Type:** A
   - **Name:** `@`
   - **Value:** The IP address Vercel provided (e.g., `76.76.21.21`)
   - **TTL:** 600 (or default)
   - Click **Add** or **Save**

2. **Update/Create CNAME for www:**
   - **Type:** CNAME
   - **Name:** `www`
   - **Value:** `cname.vercel-dns.com` (or what Vercel shows)
   - **TTL:** 600 (or default)
   - Click **Add** or **Save**

3. **Remove conflicting records:**
   - Look for any old A records pointing to different IPs
   - Remove any old CNAME records for www that point elsewhere
   - **Wait a few minutes between changes**

## Part 3: Complete Connection in Vercel

### Step 8: Verify Domain in Vercel

1. Go back to Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
3. Your domain should show as **"Valid Configuration"**
4. Click your domain â†’ Click **"Verify"**

Vercel will automatically provision an SSL certificate (this takes 1-2 minutes).

---

## Part 4: Propagation & Testing

### Step 9: Wait for DNS Propagation

- DNS changes can take **5 minutes to 48 hours**
- Usually works within **15-30 minutes**
- Use this tool to check: https://www.whatsmydns.net
  - Enter your domain
  - Look for the A record to update

### Step 10: Test Your Site

1. Once DNS propagates, visit: `https://auraesthetics.com`
2. You should see your site!
3. Test the email capture form
4. Test mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Domain not connecting

**Possible causes:**
- DNS not propagated yet (wait up to 24 hours)
- Wrong DNS records in GoDaddy
- DNS conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Double-check DNS records in GoDaddy match Vercel
2. Use https://www.whatsmydns.net to verify
3. Wait and check again

### Issue: SSL Certificate Error

**Solution:**
- Vercel provisions SSL automatically
- If you see an error, go to **Settings** â†’ **Domains** â†’ Click your domain â†’ **"Redeploy"**

### Issue: Site shows "Vercel" page

**Solution:**
- Your DNS is correct, but domain isn't fully connected
- Go to Vercel â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Domains** â†’ Click domain â†’ **"Continue"**

### Issue: Build Errors

**Solution:**
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Make sure environment variables are set
