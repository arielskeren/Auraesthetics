## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Server configuration error"
- **Problem**: Missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Make sure `.env.local` has both `BREVO_API_KEY` and `BREVO_LIST_ID` set
- **Fix**: Restart the dev server after adding credentials

### Issue: "Failed to subscribe"
- **Problem**: Invalid API key or list ID
- **Solution**: 
  - Double-check your API key in `.env.local`
  - Verify your List ID is correct
  - Make sure there are no extra spaces

### Issue: "Invalid email address"
- **Problem**: Email format is wrong
- **Solution**: Enter a valid email like `test@example.com`

### Debug Mode
Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages if something goes wrong.
