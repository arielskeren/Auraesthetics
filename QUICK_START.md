Welcome! The Aura Aesthetics website is ready for review. Here's how to see it in action.

## üì± Pages to Test

Click through each page in the navigation:

1. **Home** (`/`) - Hero, value pillars, featured services, Amy intro
2. **About** (`/about`) - Amy's bio, credentials, philosophy
3. **Services** (`/services`) - All treatments with category filter
4. **FAQ** (`/faq`) - Accordion with 10 questions
5. **Book** (`/book`) - "Coming soon" page with email capture
6. **Contact** (`/contact`) - Placeholder contact info

Also try clicking the **"Book"** button in the navigation - it should show a "Opens soon" tooltip.
